### **ONM's Principles for Open Resources**
To be considered a fully open resource in our community, a work **MUST**:
-   **Allow anyone to study, modify, and share** the material for any purpose, including commercial use.
-   **Provide materials in a publicly accessible format that allows for modification and reuse.** For text or code, this means source files (e.g., Markdown, notebooks). For other media, the published format is often the source (e.g., a CC-licensed PDF or YouTube video).
-   **Not restrict derivatives.**
-   **Not be released under a "Non-Commercial" (NC) license.**

A resource **MAY**:
-   **Require attribution** be given to the original creators (like CC-BY).
-   **Require derivatives to carry a reciprocal license** (like Share-Alike "SA" or GPL).

We will prioritize resources with permissive licenses like **CC-BY**, **CC-BY-SA**, **MIT**, and **Apache 2.0**. While we still value resources with Non-Commercial (NC) or No-Derivatives (ND) clauses, we will mark them as having restrictions, as they do not grant the full freedom to the community to build upon them.
