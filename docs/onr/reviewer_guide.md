# Open Neuromorphic Research Reviewer's Guide
This document can be used as a reference for reviewers when considering submissions.

## Core Principles:
Reviewers should be guided by the principles outlined in [this document](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304228)

**Principle 1**: I will sign my name to my review

**Principle 2**: I will review with integrity

**Principle 3**: I will treat the review as a discourse with you; in particular, I will provide constructive criticism

**Principle 4**: I will be an ambassador for the practice of open science


## Evaluation Rubric

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Reviewer Questions** |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **1. Relevance to Neuromorphic Computing** | Submission addresses a topic within the scope of neuromorphic hardware, software, methods, applications, or community building. | Does this fit within the ONR mission and topic areas? |
| **2. Clarity and Presentation** | Submission is well-organized, readable, and logically structured. Includes proper formatting and clear objectives. | Is the purpose of the work understandable? Are visuals and code outputs helpful and well-explained? |
| **3. Reproducibility** | Methods, code, and data (if applicable) are provided and clearly documented so others can replicate the work. | Could another researcher replicate the results using the materials provided? |
| **4. Technical Rigor** | The approach is appropriate and technically sound. Assumptions, parameters, and methods are well-supported. | Does the submission reflect good scientific/engineering practices? |
| **5. Contribution Type & Depth** | Clearly identifies whether this is a tool, method, experiment, or insight. Demonstrates non-trivial or novel contribution. | Is the contribution clearly articulated and meaningful in depth and originality? |
| **6. Openness and Accessibility** | Submission is open-access and includes permissive licensing for reuse (e.g., MIT, Apache, CC-BY). Uses open tools/formats. | Are all code, data, and documents accessible and reusable? |
| **7. Format Compliance** | Adheres to ONR submission guidelines (length, file types, structure, metadata, licensing, etc.) | Are filenames, licenses, and structure in line with guidance? |
| **8. Community Value** | Has potential to be reused, extended, or learned from by others in the neuromorphic community. | Would this benefit students, researchers, or developers in ONM? |
